dnstwist
========
See what sort of trouble users can get in trying to type your domain name. Find similar-looking domains that adversaries can use to attack you. Can detect typosquatting, phishing attacks, fraud and corporate espionage. Useful as an additional source of targeted threat intelligence.

Key features
------------
Just not to waste time there are several good reasons to give it a try:

- Wide range of efficient domain fuzzing algorithms
- Multithreaded job distribution
- Resolving domain names to IPv4 and IPv6
- Querying for NS and MX records
- Optional: Evaluating web page similarity with fuzzy hashes
- Optional: GeoIP location information
- Optional: Banner grabbing for HTTP and SMTP services
- Optional: WHOIS lookups for creation and modification date
- Optional: Output in CSV format

Running
-------
If you want *dnstwist* to develop full power, please make sure the following Python modules are present on your system. If missing, *dnstwist* **will still work**, but without many cool features.

- [A DNS toolkit for Python](http://www.dnspython.org/)
- [Python GeoIP](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GeoIP/)
- [Python WHOIS](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/whois)
- [Requests: HTTP for Humans](http://www.python-requests.org/)
- [ssdeep Python wrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ssdeep)

If running Ubuntu or Debian, you can install dependencies like this:

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-dnspython python-geoip python-whois python-requests
```

If you do not have a GeoIP database installed:

```
$ wget -N http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz
$ gunzip GeoIP.dat.gz
$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/GeoIP/
$ sudo mv GeoIP.dat /usr/share/GeoIP/
$ rm GeoIP.dat.gz
```

Installation of *ssdeep* module requires just a little bit more effort:

```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libffi-dev python-dev python-pip automake autoconf libtool
$ sudo BUILD_LIB=1 pip install ssdeep
```

Now it is fully equipped and ready for action.
